## Architecture

The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern:

### Models

- `Place`: Represents a restaurant with basic information
- `PlaceDetails`: Contains detailed information about a restaurant
- `FavoritePlace`: Stores user's favorite restaurants
- `PlaceRating`: Manages user's ratings for restaurants
- `UserPreferences`: Handles persistence of favorites and ratings

### ViewModels

- `MapViewModel`: Manages the map state, filtering, and place discovery
- `PlaceDetailViewModel`: Handles detailed information for a selected place
- `LocationManager`: Provides user location services

### Views

- `ContentView`: Main map interface with filtering controls
- `PlaceDetailView`: Detailed view of a restaurant with rating controls
- `EmojiSelector`: Category filter component
- `StarRatingView`: Interactive rating component

### Services

- `GooglePlacesService`: Handles API communication for place data
- `LocationManager`: Manages device location updates

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Xcode 15.0+
- iOS 16.0+
- Swift 5.9+

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sotomaque/emoji-map.git
```

2. Open the project in Xcode

```bash
cd emoji-map
open emoji-map.xcodeproj
```

3. Configure API Keys

Before running the app, you need to set up your Google Places API key. See the [Configuration Guide](CONFIGURATION.md) for detailed instructions.

4. Build and run the application

## Configuration

The app uses a flexible configuration system to manage API keys and settings:

- **CustomInfo.plist**: Main configuration file containing the Google Places API key
- **Config.plist**: Secondary configuration file for development
- **Keychain Storage**: Secure storage for production use

For detailed configuration instructions, see the [Configuration Guide](CONFIGURATION.md).

## UI Components

The app uses a variety of custom UI components:

- **NotificationBanner**: Displays temporary messages at the bottom of the screen
- **WarningBanner**: Shows important alerts at the top of the screen
- **EmojiSelector**: Horizontal scrolling category filter
- **StarRatingView**: Interactive rating component

For details on UI components and z-index management, see the [UI Components Guide](UI_COMPONENTS.md).

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive unit tests for all major components:

### Model Tests

- `UserPreferencesTests`: Tests for favorites and ratings persistence
- `CoordinateWrapperTests`: Tests for location data encoding/decoding

### ViewModel Tests

- `MapViewModelTests`: Tests for filtering, favorites, and notifications
- `PlaceDetailViewModelTests`: Tests for place details, favorites, and ratings

### View Tests

- `StarRatingViewTests`: Tests for the rating UI component

### Service Tests

- `LocationManagerTests`: Tests for location services and updates

Run the tests in Xcode using `Cmd+U` or through the Test Navigator.

## Mock Mode

The app supports a mock mode for development and testing:

1. Set `USE_MOCK_DATA=true` in your scheme environment variables
2. Run the app to use pre-defined mock data instead of real API calls
3. A warning banner will indicate when mock mode is active

Alternatively, the app will automatically switch to mock mode if no valid API key is found.

## Thread Safety

The app implements proper thread synchronization:

- Uses `@MainActor` for UI-related view models
- Implements serial queues for shared resources
- Ensures all UI updates happen on the main thread
- Properly handles task cancellation

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the app:

1. Check the [Configuration Guide](CONFIGURATION.md) for API key setup
2. Ensure all required plist files are included in the build
3. Clean the build folder and rebuild the project
4. Check the console for detailed error messages
